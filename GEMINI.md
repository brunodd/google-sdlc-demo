# The Garden of the Forgotten Prompt - Gemini CLI Extension Hackathon Guide

Welcome to "The Garden of the Forgotten Prompt" Gemini CLI Extension Hackathon!

## Game Overview
"The Garden of the Forgotten Prompt" is a text-based adventure game available at [https://adventure.wietsevenema.eu](https://adventure.wietsevenema.eu). Your goal in this hackathon is to build a Gemini CLI extension that allows users to play and interact with this game directly from their command line, leveraging the power of Gemini's extension capabilities.

## Hackathon Goal
The primary objective is to develop a fully functional and well-engineered Gemini CLI extension for "The Garden of the Forgotten Prompt." This project will showcase modern Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) practices, including:
*   Structured development from specifications.
*   Integration with Git for version control.
*   Comprehensive testing (unit and integration).
*   Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
*   Clear and concise documentation.

## Getting Started
We have outlined a series of GitHub issues to guide our development. These issues are organized into phases, starting with foundational setup and progressing to core functionality, quality assurance, and final polish.

To view the current backlog of issues, please visit the [issues page of this repository](https://github.com/Gfeuillen/google-sdlc-demo/issues).

Let's begin building an amazing extension!
